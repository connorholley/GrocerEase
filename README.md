General Overview:
  GrocerEase (Tenative name) is a mobile app that hopes to streamline the grocery shopping experience. 
  The alpha version will have an extensive database of recipes with ingredients and instructions. 
  The front end view will mimic that of a hello fresh card.
  
  The alpha version will also include a mode to keep track of which ingredients the user currently has access to within their pantry.
  Recipes can be autoselected prior to ordering grocery delivery to reduce cognitive load of planning.
  An additional filter will also be constructed to only generate recipes that only require what is currently within the pantry.

Future Ideas:
  Hopefully include caloric, price, and temporal estimates that will display on the card. 
  Investigate existing grocery store API's and see about integrating ordering groceries through these services with our application.
  Option to select recipe as a favourite. Filter to only select randomly from favourites.

Framework: 
  React native and python.

Architecture: 
  Model view controller

Goals: 
   Strenghten test writing skills in python, front end development in react native, and general knowledge of the app creation cycle.
